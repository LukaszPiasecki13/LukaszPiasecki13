## Hi there 👋, my name is Łukasz Piasecki I am Python Developer

I build web applications in Django, especially using Django Rest Framework and React.js. 
🔭 Nowadays, I devote my time to developing *Django_React_FoundTracker* application, which I use to track my investments.
🌱 Additionally, I delve into data analysis and machine learning, which I implement to automate my projects.
