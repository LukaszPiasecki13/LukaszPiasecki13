## Hi there 👋

I've been into web app creating in Django, using especially Django Rest Framework and React.js. 
🔭 Nowadays, I devote my time to developing *Django_React_FoundTracker* application, which I use to track my investments.
🌱 Additionally, I delve into data analysis and machine learning, which I implement to automate my projects.
